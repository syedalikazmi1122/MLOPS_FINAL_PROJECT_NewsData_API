Context: You are working as an MLOps team for a forward-thinking tech company that needs to move beyond static, periodically trained machine learning models. Your goal is to develop a robust, automated, and continuously monitored Real-Time Predictive System (RPS) that handles live data streams and automatically adapts to changing patterns (concept drift).
The deliverable is a fully integrated MLOps pipeline that not only trains a model but also serves and monitors it in a production-like environment.
1. Phase I: Problem Definition and Data Ingestion
The first step is selecting a real-world problem and establishing a reliable, automated data feed.
The Challenge (Step 1)
Each group must select one predictive challenge centered around time-series data from a free, live external API.
Domain
Example Free APIs
Predictive Task (Goal)
Financial
Alpha Vantage, Twelve Data
Stock/Crypto Volatility: Predict the short-term volatility or closing price for a specific asset (e.g., next hour).
Environmental
OpenWeatherMap
Localized Forecasting: Predict a key weather variable (e.g., temperature, wind speed) for a city 4-6 hours out.
Logistics
Public Transit Data
ETA/Delay: Predict the delay or arrival time of a specific transit vehicle at a future stop.


The Orchestration Core: Apache Airflow (Step 2)
Your MLOps pipeline will be structured as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in Apache Airflow. This DAG must run on a schedule (e.g., daily) and be responsible for the entire ETL and model retraining lifecycle.
Extraction (2.1): Use a Python operator to connect to your chosen API and fetch the latest live data. The raw data must be saved immediately, stamped with the collection time.
Mandatory Quality Gate: Implement a strict Data Quality Check right after extraction (e.g., check for >1% null values in key columns, or schema validation). If the data quality check fails, the DAG must fail and stop the process.
Transformation (2.2): Clean the raw data and perform essential feature engineering specific to your time-series problem (e.g., creating lag features, rolling means, or time-of-day encodings).
Documentation Artifact: Use Pandas Profiling or a similar tool to generate a detailed data quality and feature summary report.1 This report must be logged as an artifact to your MLflow Tracking Server (Dagshub).
Loading & Versioning (2.3 & 3):
The final, processed dataset must be stored in a cloud-like object storage (e.g., MinIO, AWS S3, or Azure Blob Storage).
Data Version Control (DVC): Use DVC to version this processed dataset. The small .dvc metadata file will be committed to Git, but the large dataset file itself must be pushed to your chosen remote storage.

2. Phase II: Experimentation and Model Management
MLflow & Dagshub Integration (Step 4)
The Airflow DAG will trigger the model training script (train.py). This is where robust experimentation and artifact management come into play.
MLflow Tracking: Use MLflow within the training script to track every experiment run. Log all hyperparameters, key metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared), and the final trained model as an artifact.
Dagshub as Central Hub: Configure Dagshub to act as your remote MLflow Tracking Server and DVC remote storage. This ensures all three core components—Code (Git), Data (DVC), and Models/Experiments (MLflow)—are linked and visible in a single, collaborative UI.
3. Phase III: Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)
The code lifecycle must be rigorous, using a professional branching strategy and automated checks.
Git Workflow and CI Pipeline (Step 5)
Strict Branching Model (5.1): Adhere strictly to the dev, test, and master branch model. All new work begins on feature branches and merges into dev.
Mandatory PR Approvals (5.3): Enforce Pull Request (PR) approval from at least one peer before merging into the test and master branches.





GitHub Actions with CML (5.1 & 5.2)
Use GitHub Actions to automate the CI/CD pipeline, and integrate CML (Continuous Machine Learning) for automated reporting.
Merge Event
CI Action
CML Integration
Feature $\rightarrow$ dev
Run Code Quality Checks (Linting) and Unit Tests.
N/A
dev $\rightarrow$ test
Model Retraining Test: Trigger the Airflow DAG to run a full data and model training pipeline.
Use CML to automatically generate and post a metric comparison report in the Pull Request comments, comparing the newly trained model's performance against the existing production model in master. The merge should be blocked if the new model performs worse.
test $\rightarrow$ master
Full Production Deployment Pipeline.
N/A


Containerization and Deployment (5.4 & 5.5)
Docker Containerization (5.4): The model must be served via a REST API (using FastAPI or Flask) inside a Docker container. This is your deployable unit.
Continuous Delivery: The test $\rightarrow$ master merge must trigger the final CD steps:
Fetch the best-performing model from the MLflow Model Registry.
Build the final Docker image.
Push the tagged image (e.g., app:v1.0.0) to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).2
Deployment Verification: Run the container on a minimal host (e.g., a simple docker run) to verify the service starts and responds correctly to a health check.
4. Phase IV: Monitoring and Observability
A production system is incomplete without monitoring. You must implement tools to ensure the model remains reliable.
Prometheus and Grafana
Prometheus: Embed a Prometheus data collector within your FastAPI prediction server. This service must expose metrics endpoints.
Service Metrics: Collect API inference latency and total request count.
Model/Data Drift Metrics: Expose crucial custom metrics, such as the ratio of prediction requests containing out-of-distribution feature values (a basic data drift proxy).
Grafana: Deploy Grafana and connect it to your Prometheus instance.
Live Dashboard: Create a dashboard to visualize the key service and model health metrics in real time.
Alerting Enhancement: Configure a Grafana Alert to fire (e.g., log to a Slack channel or file) if the inference latency exceeds an acceptable threshold (e.g., 500ms) or if the data drift ratio spikes.
